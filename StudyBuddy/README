Usage examples
==============
In order to register a new account, we can perform the following command:
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"username":"USERNAME", "password":"PASSWORD"}' http://ubuntu-yanivo.cloudapp.net:5001/register

After an account was created successfully, we can upload a new file to be parsed:
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d @JSON_FILE http://ubuntu-yanivo.cloudapp.net:5001/upload_document

The JSON sent needs to contain the following fields:
- username
- password
- data - The file contents encoded in base64
- force - This is optional, and will force the service to accept the file for parsing even if it was previously parsed. The value of this field must be true if passed.

After a successful file upload, a task ID will be returned in the response referencing the uploaded file. We can query the status of the task as follows:
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET http://ubuntu-yanivo.cloudapp.net:5001/get_task_status/TASK_ID

After the task is completed successfully (with status success) the data will be passed on to Elasticsearch, and will be viewable and queryable through Kibana.
